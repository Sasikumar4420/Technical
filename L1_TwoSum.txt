Leetcode 41  First Missing Positive
Approach : Cyclic Sort
	Based on the hints You must implement an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and uses O(1) auxiliary space. guess is cyclic sort could be used.
	
	
	The array is unsorted.
	The correct index of a positive integer is the integer-1 itself.
	Iterating via a while loop such that swap occurs only for positive and misplaced elements.
	Now that the array is sorted,return the first element which is misplaced.
	 
	

Placement Phase:

Iterate through the array. For each element, determine its correct position.
Swap the element to its correct position if it‚Äôs within the valid range and not already in place.
Finding Missing Positive:

After sorting, traverse the array to find the first position where the value does not match the expected value (index + 1). This index indicates the smallest missing positive integer.
Advantages of Cyclic Sort:

Efficiency: Sorts elements in place without extra space, suitable for problems with bounded integer ranges.
